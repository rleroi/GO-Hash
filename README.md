# GO-Hash
A custom hashing algorithm made for fun with a variable hash length. The algorithm is inspired by Fibonacci sequences.

# Usage
`hash filename [hash-size in bytes]`  
`hash fileToHash.dat 32` will return a 32-byte hexadecimal hash for fileToHash.dat

# Disclaimer
Please do not assume this hashing algorithm is cryptogrphically secure, I did not test for collisions (yet). It is made just for fun.
